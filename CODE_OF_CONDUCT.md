# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to foster an open and welcoming community where diverse opinions, perspectives, and backgrounds are respected. Disagreements are natural and encourages, as long as they remain constructive and civil.

No one will be excluded or penalized for holding a different viewpoint, political belief, or personal opinion, provided it is shared in a respectful and non-disruptive manner. Our focus is on creating a space where everyone feels safe to contribute while maintaining an environment of mutual respect.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Taking responsibility and apologizing for mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what benefits the community as a whole.
* Engage with ideas, not individuals. Critique specific points, not the person making them.
* Proposing alternatives during disagreements rather than dismissing perspectives outright.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Personal attacks, targeted harassment, or attempts to demean others based on their opinions, beliefs, or identity.
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Actions that disrupt collaboration or inclusivity in the community.
* Using dismissive language to shut down another member's perspective during a debate.
* Repeatedly interrupting or dominating discussions in a way that discourages others from participating.

## Mentorship and Newcomer Inclusion

As an open-source communty, we are commited to fostering a welcoming envionment where new contributors feel supported. Experienced members are encouraged to:

* Answer questions, provide guidance, and help new contributors navigate the community or project tools.
* Share knowledge openly and constructively.
* Provide actionable feedback to help newcomers grow and succeed within the project.
* Ensure documentation is clear and accessible to make onboarding smoother for everyone.

By mentoring others, we strengthen our community and ensure its values and practices are passed on effectively.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Members with differing viewpoints, political beliefs, or opinions are welcome, as long as they engage in a respectful, constructive, and inclusive manner.

Community leaders are responsible for ensuring that all contributions and interactions align with this Code of Conduct. They have the authority to:

  - Remove, edit, or reject any comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that violate these guidelines
  - Address any behavior deemed harmful, disruptive, or inappropriate.

All enforcement decisions will be reviewed by at least two leaders, and contributors will have a right to request a review if they believe a decision was unfair.

Leaders will explain decisions to maintain trust. Contributors may request a review of any decision to ensure fairness.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Appeals

If a contributor feels that an enforcement decision was unfair or misunderstood their intent, they may request an appeal. Appeals will:
  - Be reviewed transparently by community leaders.
  - Include input from impartial members where appropriate. This ensures decisions reflect community values and remain fair to all participants.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Enforcement aims to resolve conflicts constructively and fairly. No enforcement action will target someone solely for expressing a belief or opinion, provided it is shared respectfully.
