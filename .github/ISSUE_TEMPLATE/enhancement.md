## Example Enhancement Suggestion

**Title:** Add a Zoom Feature to the Minimap

**Description:**  
The minimap could include a zoom feature, allowing players to view detailed map sections or a larger overview. This enhances navigation for players exploring large maps.

**How It Works:**
1. Add zoom-in and zoom-out buttons to the minimap.
2. Modify the map rendering logic to scale based on the zoom level.
3. Test the feature with large and small maps.

**Why Itâ€™s Useful:**  
A zoom feature improves usability by making the minimap more versatile and user-friendly.
